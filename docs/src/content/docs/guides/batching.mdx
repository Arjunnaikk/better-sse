While SSE is already performant and bandwidth-efficient, sending many events at a time by repeatedly calling [`Session#push`](/better-sse/reference/api#sessionpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this) can be wasteful as every call will initiate a full TCP round trip where the client must send acknowledgement packets back for every event it receives.

*Event buffers* improve this process by allowing you to batch and send multiple events in a single network transmission, greatly improving performance and lowering overall bandwidth usage.

## Using the `batch` method

To batch and send multiple events at a time, simply invoke [`Session#batch`](/better-sse/reference/api#sessionbatch-batcher-eventbuffer--buffer-eventbuffer--void--promisevoid--promisevoid) method and pass a callback that takes an [event buffer](/better-sse/reference/api#eventbuffer) as its first argument:

```typescript title="server.ts"
await session.batch(async (buffer) => {
    await buffer.push("Hello world!");
});
```

You can use the same helper methods as you would with the session itself ([`push`](/better-sse/reference/api#sessionpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this), [`stream`](/better-sse/reference/api#sessionstream-stream-readable-options-object--promiseboolean) and [`iterate`](/better-sse/reference/api#sessioniterate-iterable-iterable--asynciterable-options-object--promisevoid)) with the buffer.

When the callback finishes execution - or resolves if it returns a promise - every event created with the buffer will be sent to the client all at once in a single network transmission.

<Aside>
    Events created with event buffers do not use the underlying `Session#push` method and will *not* trigger the `push` event to be emitted on the session instance.
</Aside>

## Create your own event buffer

You can also create an event buffer outside of the context of a single session and then write its contents to one or many sessions later on. To do so, create an event buffer and then pass it directly to the `batch` method:

```typescript title="server.ts"
import { createEventBuffer } from "better-sse";

const buffer = createEventBuffer();

buffer.iterate(["My", "huge", "event", "list"]);

session.batch(buffer);
```

Or send the buffer contents to every session on a [channel](/better-sse/guides/channels), for example:

```typescript title="server.ts"
channel.activeSessions.forEach((session) => {
    session.batch(buffer);
});
```

<Aside title="Sanitize your data" type="caution" >
    Keep in mind that, unless you explicitly pass them via [the `sanitizer` and/or `serializer` constructor arguments](#new-eventbufferoptions-), event buffers do *not* have the same data serializer and sanitizer functions as the session being called.

    This does not apply when you use the [`Session#batch`](/better-sse/reference/api(sessionbatch-batcher-eventbuffer--buffer-eventbuffer--void--promisevoid--promisevoid)) method as it will automatically copy the serializer and sanitizer from the session to the event buffer instance it creates for you.
</Aside>

### Send individual event fields

For users needing more fine-grained control over the exact data being sent over the wire, event buffers also allow you to write [raw spec-compliant SSE fields](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#processField) into a string that can be read and sent over the wire as-is.

```typescript title="server.ts"
import { createEventBuffer } from "better-sse";

const buffer = createEventBuffer();

buffer
  .retry(2400)
  .event("my-event")
  .id("123")
  .data("one")
  .data("two")
  .data("three")
  .dispatch();

res.write(buffer.read());

buffer.clear();
```

This is an advanced use-case. For most users, you should still stick with using [`Session`](/better-sse/reference/api#sessionstate) by default.
