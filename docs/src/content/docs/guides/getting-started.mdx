[Server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) is a standardised protocol that allows web-servers to push data (characterized as _events_) to a client without the client having to request it immediately before.

Using SSE can allow for significant savings in bandwidth and battery life on portable devices and will work with your existing infrastructure as it operates directly over the HTTP protocol without the need for the connection upgrade that [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) and [HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2) do (but can also be used with HTTP/2!).

Compared to WebSockets it has comparable performance and bandwidth usage, especially over HTTP/2, and natively includes event ID generation and automatic reconnection when clients are disconnected.

<Aside title="Use your own framework">
    These guides use [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Hono](https://hono.dev/) in their code examples, but Better SSE works with any web-server framework that uses the [Node HTTP module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) or the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). For example usage with other popular frameworks see the [Recipes](/better-sse/reference/recipes/) section.

### How does it work?

SSE works by a client connecting to a server using the [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) interface. The server then indicates in its response headers that it will send back data in a stream of events and keeps the connection open indefinitely until it is closed by the client. From this point the server is free to continuously write data to the open connection and the EventSource will emit events with the sent data.

<Steps>
    1. Client makes a request to the server using [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource).
    2. Server responds with the `Content-Type` header set to `text/event-stream`.
    3. Client emits the `open` event and is ready to receive data.
    4. Server continually writes text data to the open connection.
    5. Client receives data and emits events on the `EventSource` instance.
    6. Client terminates connection by calling the `close` method.
</Steps>

The technology can be used for things such as live notifications, news tickers, chat rooms, shout-boxes, event logs, progress bars, etc.

### Install

Better SSE is shipped as a package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sse) and the [JSR](https://jsr.io/@mwid/better-sse). You can install it with any package manager.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="npm">
        <Code code={`npm install better-sse`} lang="shellscript" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Yarn">
        <Code code={`yarn add better-sse`} lang="shellscript" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pnpm">
        <Code code={`pnpm add better-sse`} lang="shellscript" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Bun">
        <Code code={`bun add better-sse`} lang="shellscript" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Deno">
        <Code code={`deno install jsr:@mwid/better-sse`} lang="shellscript" />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

TypeScript types are included in the package distribution. No need to install from DefinitelyTyped for TypeScript users!

## Create a session

*Sessions* simply represent an open connection between a client and the server. The client will first make a request to the server and the server will open a session that it will push data to the client with.

First import the module:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="ESModules / TypeScript">
        <Code code={`import { createSession } from "better-sse"`} lang="typescript" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="CommonJS">
        <Code code={`const { createSession } = require("better-sse")`} lang="javascript" />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then create a session when the client makes a request on the specified route (`GET /sse` in this case):

<Tabs syncKey="framework">
    <TabItem label="Express">
        ```typescript
        app.get("/sse", async (req, res) => {
            const session = await createSession(req, res)
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Hono">
        ```typescript
        app.get("/sse", (c) => 
             return createResponse(c.req.raw, (session) => {
                // ...
            })
        )
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that we have an active session we can use it to *push* an event to the client:

```typescript
session.push("Hello world!", "ping")
```

This will push the string `Hello world!` to the client as an event named `ping` (defaults to `message` if no name is given.)

<Aside title="createSession or createResponse?">
    <details>
        <summary>If your framework uses the Fetch API use [`createResponse`](/better-sse/reference/api/#createresponse-stateargs-constructorparameterstypeof-session-callback-session-sessionstate--void--response), otherwise use [`createSession`](/better-sse/reference/api/#createsession-stateargs-constructorparameterstypeof-session--promisesessionstate)</summary>

        After creating a session we must wait for the underlying connection to be initialized before we can begin pushing events to it.

        When using the Node [HTTP/1](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) or [HTTP/2](https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html#compatibility-api) APIs we can flush the response headers and any other preamble data ahead of time and thus immediately begin pushing events to the session:

        ```typescript
        // Express uses the Node HTTP/1 API
        app.get("/sse", async (req, res) => {
            const session = await createSession(req, res)
            session.push("Hello world!")
        })
        ```

        When using a [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)-based framework, however, we must first return a [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object from our route handler for the session to able to connect and send data.

        We can either do this manually:

        ```typescript
        // Hono uses the Fetch API
        app.get("/sse", async (c) => {
            const session = await createSession(c.req.raw)

            session.addListener("connected", () => {
                session.push("Hello world!")
            })

            return session.getResponse()
        })
        ```

        Or use the shorthand [`createResponse`](/better-sse/reference/api/#createresponse-stateargs-constructorparameterstypeof-session-callback-session-sessionstate--void--response) utility function:

        ```typescript
        app.get("/sse", (c) => 
            return createResponse(c.req.raw, (session) => {
                session.push("Hello world!")
            })
        )
        ```

        The previous two code snippets are equivalent.

### Connect from the client

From your client-side code you can now connect to the server at the defined path.

<Aside type="tip">
    It is **highly** recommended you use an [EventSource polyfill](/better-sse/reference/compatibility/browser/#polyfills) that allows for backwards compatibility with older browsers as well as giving you extra features such as request header modification, improved error handling and greater control over reconnection behaviour.
</Aside>

First we open a connection to the server to begin receiving events:

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource("/sse")
```

Then we can attach an event listener to listen for the event our server is going to send:

```javascript
eventSource.addEventListener("ping", (event) => {
	console.log(`${event.type} | ${event.data}`)
})
```

If you check your browser console you will now see `ping | "Hello world!"` logged to the console. Easy!

<Aside>
    Event data is serialized to JSON with [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) by default. You can use `JSON.parse(event.data)` to get its real value.
</Aside>

You can find a reference to the received event object interface on the [`MessageEvent` page on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource/message_event).
