Frequently asked questions related to using Better SSE.

If you have any additional queries that are not answered here, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MatthewWid/better-sse/issues/new) and use the [`question` label](https://github.com/MatthewWid/better-sse/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aquestion).

## What's the catch?

While SSE is performant, bandwidth-efficient and works on a very simple protocol there are still a number of considerations you should make when deciding between real-time web technologies.

Some of those considerations are listed below.

### Connection limit

When using HTTP/1.1, most web browsers impose a limit of six (6) concurrently open connections per browser to each domain. This limitation is non-standard and arbitrary, originating from a recommendation in the now-obsolete [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.1.4) and [removed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160307164327/http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/131) in the current HTTP/1.1 specification defined in [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html). Nevertheless, [most browsers](https://docs.diffusiondata.com/cloud/latest/manual/html/designguide/solution/support/connection_limitations.html) continue to implement it and have marked relevant issues as "Won't Fix" ([Chrome](https://crbug.com/275955), [Firefox](https://bugzil.la/906896)).

This means that if you open six [event sources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) at a time, or have one event source duplicated across six open tabs, for example, any new requests made to the same domain will stall until one of the existing connections is [closed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource/close).

There are a number of ways to work around this:

1. Use [HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2) as it allows for many more and even unlimited concurrent connections (typically defaults to [100](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.5.2)) as well as offering better performance in general.
2. Use multiple hostnames to distribute connections across. For example, rather than connecting to `example.com/sse`, create a mechanism that chooses to connect to any of `api1.example.com/sse`, `api2.example.com/sse`, etc.
3. Share a single event source and connection that stays open in a separate [Shared Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker) that all tabs [listen for messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessagePort/message_event) on.
4. Share a single event source and connection that stays open in a designated "leader" tab elected with the [Web Locks API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Locks_API) that other tabs listen for messages on using the [Broadcast Channel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API).

### UTF-8 data only

You may only send data encoded in [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), according to [the spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html):

> Event streams are always decoded as UTF-8. There is no way to specify another character encoding.

As such, if you wish to send binary data you need to first encode it as [Base64](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64) on the server and then decode it on the client-side (see [`btoa`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/btoa) and [`atob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/atob)):

```typescript title="server.ts"
const encoded = btoa(binary)
session.push(encoded, "binary-data")
```

```typescript title="client.ts"
eventSource.addEventListener("binary-data", ({ data }) => {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(data)
    const decoded = atob(parsed)
    console.log(decoded)
})
```

### Manage timeouts

Some servers, proxies and load balancers set a timeout on HTTP/1.1 connections. For example, [AWS ALBs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elb-idle-timeout-control/) default to 60 seconds, [Azure load balancers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-tcp-reset) default to 4 minutes, the [Bun HTTP API](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http#idletimeout) defaults to ten (10) seconds.

If this timeout is based on connection idle time, you can change the keep-alive interval to a number below the threshold using the `keepAlive` option in the [`Session` constructor](/better-sse/reference/api/#new-sessionstate--defaultsessionstatereq-incomingmessage--http2serverrequest--request-res-serverresponse--http2serverresponse--response--sessionoptions-options-sessionoptions) arguments:

```typescript title="server.ts"
const session = await createSession(req, res, {
    keepAlive: 5_000, // 5 seconds
})
```

Otherwise, you should disable these timeouts or set them to a value sufficiently high that you can tolerate repeated reconnection:

* [Nginx configuration for SSE](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13673298/2954591)
* [AWS ELB timeout configuration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elb-idle-timeout-control/)
* [Azure load balancer timeout configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-tcp-idle-timeout?tabs=tcp-reset-idle-portal)
* [GCP load balancer timeout configuration](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#timeout-setting)

Note that clients that are disconnected, including due to being timed out, will automatically attempt to reconnect after a short delay. You can configure the delay time using the `retry` option in the [`Session` constructor](/better-sse/reference/api/#new-sessionstate--defaultsessionstatereq-incomingmessage--http2serverrequest--request-res-serverresponse--http2serverresponse--response--sessionoptions-options-sessionoptions) arguments:

```typescript title="server.ts"
const session = await createSession(req, res, {
    retry: 30_000, // 30 seconds
})
```

### Manage reconnection

When clients are disconnected they will automatically attempt to reconnect after a short delay.

This is useful, but if you have many active sessions built up over time and then, for example, the server goes down momentarily, you will end up with a large number of clients all attempting to reconnect at the same time, leading to a sudden spike in traffic and potentially overwhelming the server. This is known as the [thundering herd problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem).

To prevent this, you can use the `retry` option given to the [`Session` constructor](/better-sse/reference/api/#new-sessionstate--defaultsessionstatereq-incomingmessage--http2serverrequest--request-res-serverresponse--http2serverresponse--response--sessionoptions-options-sessionoptions) arguments to request each client have a random delay offset before reconnecting:

```typescript title="server.ts"
const randomNumber = (min: number, max: number) =>
    Math.floor(Math.random() * max) + min

const session = await createSession(req, res, {
    retry: randomNumber(5_000, 60_000), // Random delay between 5 seconds and 1 minute
})
```

Alternatively, you can use an event source polyfill that supports [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) from the client-side such as [Event Source Plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/event-source-plus).

Keep in mind you can ask clients to stop reconnecting by sending a [`204 No Content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/204) response code.

### Disable caching and buffering

Some servers, proxies and load balancers attempt to cache, compress and/or buffer data before it is sent to the client. While this is good for normal short-lived HTTP connections, it is not desirable for real-time communication as it prevents data from being delivered to the client immediately.

Better SSE [adds headers](https://github.com/MatthewWid/better-sse/blob/61e77c616396831fa2d984df37e0d268d1a45900/src/utils/constants.ts#L7) for you that indicate caching, buffering and compression should be disabled, but some proxies and load balancers may still not respect them, meaning you need to disable this behaviour manually.

* [Nginx configuration for SSE](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13673298/2954591)
* [Azure configuration for SSE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/how-to-server-sent-events)
* [GCP Apigee configuration for SSE](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/develop/server-sent-events)

## Is this the same thing as Server Push?

No.

[HTTP/2 Server Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push), or just Server Push, is an old and now-unimplemented feature of the HTTP/2 specification that is unrelated to server-sent events.

SSE is still part of the [current living standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html) and is [supported by all modern web browsers](/better-sse/reference/compatibility/browser/).

## How do I disconnect a session from the server?

To disconnect a session from the server you can simply close the underlying connection (call [`ServerResponse#end`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#responseenddata-encoding-callback) if using the [Node HTTP API](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) or [`ReadableStream#cancel`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/cancel) on the [stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) in the [body of the `Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/body) returned by [`Session#getResponse`](/better-sse/reference/api/#sessiongetresponse---response) if using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).)

However, according to [the spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#concept-event-stream-reconnection-time), this will cause the client to attempt to reconnect after a short timeout (the exact time can be changed using the `retry` option given to the [`Session` constructor](/better-sse/reference/api/#new-sessionstate--defaultsessionstatereq-incomingmessage--http2serverrequest--request-res-serverresponse--http2serverresponse--response--sessionoptions-options-sessionoptions).)

As such, you could instead add a mechanism that makes the client disconnect *themselves* when they receive a specific event. For example, with an event named `disconnect`:

```typescript title="client.ts"
const source = new EventSource("/sse")

source.addEventListener("disconnect", () => {
    source.close()
})
```

Then from the server, simply send that event to clients you wish to disconnect permanently:

```typescript title="server.ts"
session.push(null, "disconnect")
```

You can also ask new clients to stop reconnecting by sending a [`204 No Content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/204) response code.

## How do I add metadata to a session or channel?

Both [sessions](/better-sse/reference/api/#sessionstate-state) and [channels](/better-sse/reference/api/#channelstate-state) have a `state` property that you can use to store any metadata associated with them.

For sessions, keep in mind that state only persists for the lifetime of the session. If the client disconnects and reconnects you will get a new session and thus must set its state again.

You can provide an initial state value in the constructor options, allowing its type to be inferred:

<Tabs syncKey="framework">
    <TabItem label="Express">
        ```typescript
        app.get("/sse", async (req, res) => {
            const session = await createSession(req, res, {
                state: {
                    username: "Alice",
                }
            })

            session.state.username = 123456 // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Hono">
        ```typescript
        app.get("/sse", (c) =>
            createResponse(
                request,
                {
                    state: {
                        username: "Alice",
                    },
                },
                (session) => {
                    session.state.username = 123456 // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
                }
            )
        )
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or provide the type explicitly to its first generic argument:

<Tabs syncKey="framework">
    <TabItem label="Express">
        ```typescript
        type SessionState = {
            username: string,
        }

        app.get("/sse", async (req, res) => {
            const session = await createSession<SessionState>(req, res)

            session.state.username = "Alice"
            session.state.username = 123456 // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Hono">
        ```typescript
        type SessionState = {
            username: string,
        }

        app.get("/sse", (c) =>
            createResponse<SessionState>(c.req.raw, (session) => {
                session.state.username = "Alice"
                session.state.username = 123456 // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
            })
        )
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can set the default state type for all sessions and/or channels using [module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation) and [declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#merging-interfaces) to modify the `DefaultSessionState` and `DefaultChannelState` interfaces:

<Tabs syncKey="framework">
    <TabItem label="Express">
        ```typescript
        declare module "better-sse" {
            interface DefaultSessionState {
                username: string
            }
        }

        app.get("/sse", async (req, res) => {
            const session = await createSession(req, res)

            session.state.username = "Alice"
            session.state.username = 123456 // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Hono">
        ```typescript
        declare module "better-sse" {
            interface DefaultSessionState {
                username: string
            }
        }

        app.get("/sse", (c) =>
            createResponse(c.req.raw, (session) => {
                session.state.username = "Alice"
                session.state.username = 123456 // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
            })
        )
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can use the second generic argument to the [`Channel` constructor](/better-sse/reference/api/#channelstate-sessionstate) to define the state type of its registered sessions, enforcing that only sessions with a matching state type may be registered:

<Tabs syncKey="framework">
    <TabItem label="Express">
        ```typescript
        type AuthenticatedState = {
            userId: string
        }

        type UnauthenticatedState = {
            tempId: string
        }

        const protectedChannel = createChannel<DefaultChannelState, AuthenticatedState>()

        app.get("/sse", async (req, res) => {
            if (isAuthenticated()) {
                const session = await createSession<AuthenticatedState>(req, res)
                protectedChannel.register(session)
            } else {
                const session = await createSession<UnauthenticatedState>(req, res)
                // Error: Argument of type 'SessionState<UnauthenticatedState>'
                // is not assignable to parameter of type 'SessionState<AuthenticatedState>'
                protectedChannel.register(session)
            }
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Hono">
        ```typescript
        type AuthenticatedState = {
            userId: string
        }

        type UnauthenticatedState = {
            tempId: string
        }

        const protectedChannel = createChannel<DefaultChannelState, AuthenticatedState>()

        app.get("/sse", (c) => {
            if (isAuthenticated()) {
                return createResponse<AuthenticatedState>(c.req.raw, (session) => {
                    protectedChannel.register(session)
                })
            } else {
                return createResponse<UnauthenticatedState>(c.req.raw, (session) => {
                    // Error: Argument of type 'SessionState<UnauthenticatedState>'
                    // is not assignable to parameter of type 'SessionState<AuthenticatedState>'
                    protectedChannel.register(session)
                })
            }
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This also allows you to filter broadcasts based on session state with proper typing:

```typescript
type SessionState = {
    priority: number
}

const channel = createChannel<DefaultChannelState, SessionState>()

channel.broadcast("High priority update", "status-update", {
    filter: (session) => session.state.priority > 50,
})
```

## How do I track and send events to a specific user across multiple sessions?

To track and send events only to certain users you can create a dedicated [channel](/better-sse/reference/api/#channelstate-sessionstate) that groups each users' active sessions together. Then when you want to send an event to them, simply broadcast it on their associated channel.

First update your client-side code to send a user ID along with the request:

```typescript title="client.ts"
const userId = authAndGetUserId()

const url = new URL("/sse", window.location.origin)

url.searchParams.set("userId", userId)

const source = new EventSource(url)
```

Then on the server create a [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) from the user ID to a channel and register new sessions with them:

<Tabs syncKey="framework">
    <TabItem label="Express">
        ```typescript
        import { type Channel, createChannel, createSession } from "better-sse"

        const userIdToChannel = new Map<string, Channel>()

        app.get("/sse", async (req, res) => {
            const { userId } = req.query

            // Authenticate the user owns this ID

            const session = await createSession(req, res)

            if (!userIdToChannel.has(userId)) {
                userIdToChannel.set(userId, createChannel())
            }

            const channel = userIdToChannel.get(userId)!

            channel.register(session)
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Hono">
        ```typescript
        import { type Channel, createChannel, createResponse } from "better-sse"

        const userIdToChannel = new Map<string, Channel>()

        app.get("/sse", (c) => {
            const { userId } = c.req.query()

            // Authenticate the user owns this ID

            return createResponse(c.req.raw, (session) => {
                if (!userIdToChannel.has(userId)) {
                    userIdToChannel.set(userId, createChannel())
                }

                const channel = userIdToChannel.get(userId)!

                channel.register(session)
            })
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now when you want to send an event to a specific user, broadcast it on their associated channel:

```typescript title="server.ts"
userIdToChannel.get(userId)?.broadcast("For your eyes only")
```

You can also see if a user is online at any given time by checking if they have any active sessions:

```typescript title="server.ts"
const isUserOnline = (userId: string) =>
    userIdToChannel.get(userId)?.sessionCount > 0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting the error "Cannot push data to a non-active session."?

This error occurs when you are attempting to [push](/better-sse/reference/api/#sessionpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this) an event to a session that is not currently connected (or implicitly doing so from a [stream](/better-sse/reference/api/#sessionstream-stream-streamreadable--readablestream-options-object--promiseboolean) or [iterable](/better-sse/reference/api/#sessioniterate-iterable-iterable--asynciterable-options-object--promisevoid) that is still attached and yielding data after the session has been disconnected.)

You can use the [`Session#isConnected`](/better-sse/reference/api/#sessionisconnected-boolean) property to check if a session is connected at any given time.

When using [`createSession`](/better-sse/reference/api/#createsession-stateargs-constructorparameterstypeof-session--promisesessionstate) with the Fetch API you might be pushing events before the session has connected as it returns immediately without waiting for the underlying connection to be established:

```typescript
app.get("/sse", async (c) => {
    const session = await createSession(c.req.raw)

    session.push("Hello world!") // Error: Cannot push data to a non-active session.
})
```

You can either manually wait for the `connected` event to fire or use the [`createResponse`](/better-sse/reference/api/#createresponse-stateargs-constructorparameterstypeof-session-callback-session-sessionstate--void--response) utility function instead:

```typescript
app.get("/sse", async (c) => {
    const session = await createSession(c.req.raw)

    session.addListener("connected", () => {
        session.push("Hello world!")
    })
})
```

Additionally, make sure to clean up any async iterables and streams when the session disconnects:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="node:stream">
        ```typescript
        const stream = Readable.from(...)

        session.stream(stream)

        session.once("disconnected", () => {
            stream.destroy()
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Web Streams API">
        ```typescript
        const stream = ReadableStream.from(...)

        session.stream(stream)

        session.once("disconnected", () => {
            stream.cancel()
        })
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Why am I getting the error "Cannot register a non-active session."?

This error occurs when you attempt to [register](/better-sse/reference/api/#channelregister-session-session--this) a session to a channel that is not currently connected.

You can use the [`Session#isConnected`](/better-sse/reference/api/#sessionisconnected-boolean) property to check if a session is connected at any given time.

When using [`createSession`](/better-sse/reference/api/#createsession-stateargs-constructorparameterstypeof-session--promisesessionstate) with the Fetch API you might be attempting to register the session before it has connected as it returns immediately without waiting for the underlying connection to be established:

```typescript
app.get("/sse", async (c) => {
    const session = await createSession(c.req.raw)

    channel.register(session) // Error: Cannot register a non-active session.
})
```

You can either manually wait for the `connected` event to fire or use the [`createResponse`](/better-sse/reference/api/#createresponse-stateargs-constructorparameterstypeof-session-callback-session-sessionstate--void--response) utility function instead:

```typescript
app.get("/sse", async (c) => {
    const session = await createSession(c.req.raw)

    session.addListener("connected", () => {
        channel.register(session)
    })
})
```
